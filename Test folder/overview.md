WALDO
======

Introduction
------------

People with learning disabilities can encounter difficulty in expressing themselves in speech. Makaton is a language programme that uses signs and symbols to enable users of all ages to communicate effectively. WALDO is a machine learning-enabled assisted living device meant for use by Makaton users and their carers in a care home setting. WALDOâ€™s capabilities include:

* Makaton sign language interpretation using machine learning
* Easy-to-use interface, and a cute and endearing package to encourage use by people with learning disabilities and their carers
* Programmable buttons for users to quickly express pre-set phrases or emotions

Intended Use
------------

WALDO is intended for use in a care home setting in the following ways:

Makaton sign interpretation
1. Makaton user (care home patient) signs to WALDO
2. WALDO uses machine learning to interpret sign
3. WALDO vocalises sign for carer to understand what user intends to express
4. Carer reacts accordingly, completing the interaction between the user and carer
This implementation enables the carer to understand the user without having to undergo the time-consuming process of learning Makaton.

Expression of pre-set phrases/emotions
1. User (by him/herself, or via carer) sets common phrases that he/she uses frequently to correspond to physical buttons on WALDO
2. User labels buttons accordingly for ease of use
3. User presses the relevant button, WALDO vocalises pre-set phrase
4. Carer responds accordingly
This implementation enables people with learning disabilities that have difficulty expressing themselves in speech to easily express everyday sentiments.
