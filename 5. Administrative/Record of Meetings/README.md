Overview of Meetings
====================

Over the course of this project, meetings were scheduled with the following regularity:

* Video conference meetings with IBM supervisors every Friday at 2pm
* Fortnightly meetings with academic supervisor, Dr Steve Wright, on Wednesday at 2pm

Minutes for meetings with IBM and academic supervisors were taken and are included in this folder; these minutes include a record of decisions taken and their rationale. The calendar below presents a timeline of the project, and a frame of reference for understanding the meeting minutes.
